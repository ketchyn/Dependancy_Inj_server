<p>We plan to invest 626,480 USD. shares in the factory for the production of bricks for the next 4 years. The investment plan is to purchase shares in the beginning of the year and selling them at the end of the same year. Money saved can then be re-invested (all or part) at the beginning of next year. The degree of risk presented investment  Fact that profit is probabilistic, according to an analysis of investment risks<br>
		  The study suggests that the risk that the return on investment depends on market conditions m (favorable or unfavorable). The condition leads to profit k Rk with probability Pk, k = 1,2,..., m. Challenge is to develop an investment strategy for the largest accumulation until the end of n-year period.<br>
	    We introduce the notation:</p>
<li>Xi &ndash; the amount of cash available for investment at the beginning of the i-th year (x1 = C);</li>
<li>Yi &ndash; the amount of real investment in the beginning i-year (Yi &le; Xi)

	    <p>Let Fi (Xi) &ndash; the maximum expected amount of cash flows for the period from the i-th and n-year provided that at the beginning of the i-th year is the amount Xi. Our initial investment of 626,480 USD and is scheduled for 4-year period. There is a 58% probability that the money will bring 70% of which 16% &gt; 84 serednnogo profit and average income. and 42% &ndash; 28% of investment to lose.

      <p>So, in this case, the production design as a whole is characterized by a low degree of risk of 28%. as with very high probability the project NPV is positive, and the calculated maximum amount of risk in the implementation of the pessimistic scenario is 44279 UAH. <br>
      <p>Thus the project can be approved. However, it is to insure against the risk of delays launch facilities (construction and installation). as well as the risk of higher costs (for example, by acquiring options to buy gold). Also, you need to pay attention to product promotion: advertising company policy and choice of sales. It can be done. based on past practice or by treatment of leases and contracts for the supply chain distributors. In conclusion, the application of this approach to the analysis of project risks will often already at the first stage of the project evaluation to decide on the further processing. as well as to draw conclusions about possible ways to minimize the risks. It should be emphasized that a prerequisite of such an analysis must be justified by expert estimates, otherwise efficiency will be low.</p>

<h3><a name="p5"></a><a href="#p5">Conclusion</a></h3>
			
			<p>It should be noted that all projects and most aspects of the project in one degree or another risky. They may be subject to financial, organizational. social, political and other types of risk. Considering the risk as the uncertainty affects investment income. it can be operated as an activity that is Various methods and measures to predict risk and identify methods to reduce it. So essential to achieve success in the sphere of activity, which is characterized by increased riskiness is the creation and improvement of risk management systems that help identify, assess, locate and monitor risk.
			<p>Decision-making mechanism should not only identify the risk, but also provide an opportunity to assess what risks and to what extent can take on the company. as well as to determine the appropriate expected return justifies the risk. The study was the discovery of the production design as a whole is characterized by a low degree of risk of 28%. as with very high probability the project NPV is positive. So, the project may be accepted. However, it is to insure against the risk of delays launch facilities (construction and installation), as well as the risk of higher costs (for example, by acquiring options to buy gold). Also, you need to pay attention to product promotion: advertising company policy and choice of sales.<br>
